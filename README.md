# IA_DEM_Roughness
Using Image Analysis techniques to identify pixels of a DEM with low surface roughness and slope

## Image Slice and Stitch Goals
- Create a function that can slice an image into however many tiles of specified shape to reduce computing power for image analysis
- Create a function that will successfully stitch the tiles back together post-analysis into an image the same size as the original shape

## tile_slicer

**tile_slicer(image, shape)**
  Divides a given image into uniform tiles (except for at the edges) of specified shape. Returns the tiles in a dictionary with the location of each
  of the tiles as keys and the tiles as values.
  
  **Parameters:** image : array_like
                    Input image.
                    
                  shape : tuple of ints
                    Desired tile size as a two dimensional shape.
                    
  **Returns:**  tile_dict : dictionary (keys : tuple of ints; values : array_like)
                  The keys are the original tile locations with the origin as the top left corner, and the values are the tiles.
                  
               saved_locs : dictionary (keys: tuple of ints; values : list of ints)
                  The keys are the original tile locations with the origin as the top left corner, and the values are the locations used to subset the tiles.
                  
               im_shape : tuple of ints
                  The shape of the original image.
                  
                  
**tif_stitch(tiles, saved_locs, im_shape)**
