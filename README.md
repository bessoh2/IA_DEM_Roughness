# IA_DEM_Roughness
Using Image Analysis techniques to identify pixels of a DEM with low surface roughness and slope

## Project Goals
* Learn about the posibilities of image analysis techniques for use with satellite data
* Create a computationally efficient moving window function for use on large images
* Develop a tiling and stitching function to reduce the size of the image being worked on while preserving the original location of each tile
* Identify areas of low slope and low surface roughness for use with ICESat-2 satellite data

## General Workflow
1. Run the FirstLookGM notebook to find the standard deviation that is most common at Grand Mesa, a location where ICESat-2 has been known to perform with high accuracy. You will need a DEM of Grand Mesa, which can be downloaded from https://nsidc.org/data/ASO_3M_SD/versions/1
2. If the file size is extremely large, first use the slice_and_stitch.py function to tile the original DEM into tiles, then run the standard deviation function (and any other desired analysis) on each tile before stitching those tiles back together.
3. Run the Terrain_Roughness_Slope notebook. This will require a DEM of the study area (in our original case, this is Tuolumne Meadows, available here: https://nsidc.org/data/ASO_3M_SD/versions/1 ) as well as a .csv with ICESat-2 points with a geometries column (which can be output during preprocessing by loading the downloaded and processed data into a geodataframe and then outputting as a .csv: raw data can be downloaded from: https://nsidc.org/data/atl08 ). In this study, we ran code on a subset image from the Tuolumne DEM, with an image size of 5000x5000 pixels.
