# IA_DEM_Roughness
Using Image Analysis techniques to identify pixels of a DEM with low surface roughness and slope

## Project Goals
* Learn about the posibilities of image analysis techniques for use with satellite data
* Create a computationally efficient moving window function for use on large images
* Identify areas of low slope and low surface roughness for use with ICESat-2 satellite data
